# Week 4 Challenge - Build with Gemini

## Overview

Welcome to the final week of Vibe Summer! This week, we're diving into the world of Generative AI with the **[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/)**. Your challenge is to build a creative and useful AI agent or MCP server that leverages the power of Gemini.

This is your chance to bring everything you've learned together. Let's end Vibe Summer with a bang!

## Challenge Theme: "Gemini x MCP"

Build something creative that showcases the power of combining the Gemini API with MCP. Think about a task you'd love to automate, a creative idea you want to bring to life, or a problem you'd like to solve.

You can either integrate Gemini into an MCP server, or use Gemini as agent to interact with the MCP Server. You can choose between:

- **Option 1**: Build a new MCP server using the power of the Gemini API
- **Option 2:** Enhance the MCP server from previous challenges with the power of the Gemini API
- **Option 3**: Use Gemini as your agent to call the MCP server. (Gemini SDK has MCP tool callong support, [see docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling?example=weather#mcp))

## Requirements

- **Build with the Gemini API**: Your project must use the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) as its core. You can use any model from the API, such as:
    - Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
    - Veo 3
    - Imagen 4
    - Gemini TTS models
    - Gemini Embeddings
    - and more
- **Get a free API key**: You can get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- **Recommended SDKs**: We recommend using one of the following SDKs for your project:
   - The official [Google GenAI JS/TS SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai)
   - [Vercel AI SDK with the Google Generative AI provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai)

Note: All Gemini models on the Gemini API are included in the free tier, but for certain special models such as Veo 3 and Imagen 4 you'd have to upgrade your account. Check out the [pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) for more details.

### Optional Fun
*   Use the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) to interact with your MCP server.


## Getting Started

1.  **Get your Gemini API Key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to create your key.
2.  **Explore the Gemini Documentation**: The [Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) is your best friend.
3.  **Choose your SDK**:
    - For the Google GenAI JS/TS SDK, check out the [repository](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai) and the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) for code examples.
    - For the Vercel AI SDK, follow the [Get Started with AI SDK and Gemini guide](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/guides/gemini-2-5) and the [Google Generative AI provider docs](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai).
4.  **Deploy your app**: Deploy your agent and/or MCP server to a public URL.

## Submission

- A link to your deployed MCP server and/or agent.
- A few words about your app and what it does
- A short video/screenshare (max 2 min) walking through your app and code
- A link to your Fiberplane Codegen Project (if you used it).
- (Optional) A link to your GitHub repo

### Deadlines

- Deadline for the challenge prize, Wednesday, August 27th, 2025, 11:59 PM (PT)
